-- All .Internal calls have been removed.
-- .onLoad: bug fixed (thanks to Prof Brian Ripley). system.file is now invoked with lib.loc = libname.
-- population.check: less tight check on factor columns: now ONLY the values stored into df.population and
                     into template are requested to be identical (and equally ordered). Formerly a mismatch
                     in the levels attribute raised an error (which actually does not affect the results).
-- bounds.hint: works better when either of the bounds of the star interval is not finite
-- g.range: small change (now works better if zeros in initial and calibrated weights are not tied)

-- kottcalibrate: minor bug fixed (added drop = FALSE in mm[ , !zz, drop = FALSE])
-- kottcalibrate: checks added on bounds (must be numeric and must satisfy bounds[1] <= 1 <= bounds[2])
-- population.check: default value (FALSE) for 'partition' argument was lacking, despite documented.
-- g.range: minor bug (was not working for objects that have undergone subsequent calibrations, due to
            erroneous name reconstruction of last but one weights)
-- LICENCE: removed non ASCII characters

-- kottby, kottby.user, kott.ratio, kott.quantile, kott.regcoef: NEW argument 'vartype' allows to request every
                                                                 possible combination of: SE, CV, CV%, Var

-- NEW bounds.hint function: helps the user when performing range restricted calibration. Suggests a sound
                             'bounds' value for which kottcalibrate is likely to converge.

-- g.range BUG fix: g-weights lower value was erroneously 0 whenever there was a zero calibration weight
                    corresponding to a non zero direct weight (thus erroneously missing possible negative
                    g-weights).

-- Typo in a kottcalibrate message ('prameter')

-- Help page for population.check missed a \code{} around a 'kottcalibrate' and had 2 'deskott' instead of
   'data'
